# Plotpeak
This application can convert all the raw files (such as .xye) in a folder into separate profile images with peak value of d-spacing and/or 2-theta in just one click. Additionally, it also plot all profiles on the same graph to ease comparison. It offers a solution to the common problems encountered in scientific research while plotting XRD profiles, such as errors due to the presence of headers in the raw files provided by instruments and inconsistencies between the wavelength of the original X-ray (such as synchrotron or other light sources) and the in-house X-ray wavelength (Copper K-Î±), necessitating conversion. Furthermore, the code can also be utilized to plot other spectra, such as Raman, FTIR and so on.

#Instructions
1. Download and run "Plotpeak_Installer_web.exe", it will install the MATLAB Runtime.
2. Download "Plotpeak_v6.exe" and put it into the .xye file folder.
3. Run the application and read the instructions inside.
