# Plot

This code has the ability to convert all the files in a folder into separate profile images with peak value of d-spacing and/or 2-theta in just one click. Additionally, it enables you to plot all profiles on the same graph to ease comparison. It offers a solution to the common problems encountered in scientific research while plotting XRD profiles, such as errors due to the presence of headers in the raw files provided by instruments and inconsistencies between the wavelength of the original X-ray and the in-house X-ray wavelength (Copper K-Î±) in synchrotron or other light sources, necessitating conversion. Furthermore, the code can also be utilized to plot spectra, such as Raman and so on.
